The steady rhythmic beat of the turbine blades can be heard high above, a comforting sound as each turn collects energy to power the splendid metropolis below.

It is in the cold morning hours of predawn and a large, bald man wearing a non military sailor outfit wearily drags out a large black key and enters. He climbs 5 flights of stairs, his feet feel like lead. Reaching the green door of his apartment he pushes the key in the lock, with a click the thick wooden door opens revealing a messy, one bedroom apartment.",
